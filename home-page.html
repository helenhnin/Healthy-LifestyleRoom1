					A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Not all diseases are preventable, but a large one: proportion of deaths, particularly those from coronary heart disease and lung cancer can be avoided. A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. When we look after our physical health, we feel better and fitter, more relaxed and better able to cope with things. This is especially important when you have a mental illness. There are lots of ways of being healthy that feel good as well as doing you good.Good nutrition, daily exercise and adequate sleep are the foundations of healthy living. According to WHO, healthy living is a way of living that helps you enjoy more aspects of your life.This means eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and drugs and getting plenty of rest. Our bodies are like machines that require a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals and water to stay in good working order. Get the balance wrong and your health will suffer.
