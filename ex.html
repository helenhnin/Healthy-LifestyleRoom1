         <h3>"What is consistency in exercise"</h3>
         <p class="p">
         Consistency is key to realizing the many benefits of exercise.Once a week will not help you meet your goals.One of the main benefits of consistent exercise is maintaining a healthy weight. Put simply, energy out must equal to or greater than energy in. That energy balance is vital.A commitment to a regular workout regimen will increase your fitness level, improve your health and generate a greater sense of mental well being.</p>
         <p class="divimg"><img src="eximg/consistency.jpg" class="consistency" title="https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/ABZ_m5RPiLpvSfAAscDa2S8LlHA=/fit-in/1600x0/filters:focal(800x602:801x603)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/1f/9a/1f9acb47-7f4e-499a-854c-1a93e355130f/gettyimages-861458264_web.jpg"></p>
        <p class="p">
            Consistency is the critical driver for success. Being consistent means dedicating yourself to your goals and staying focused on the things and activities to achieve your goals. Consistency requires a long-term commitment from you and involves sustained effort in doing actions repeatedly until you achieve your goals.It's hard to be consistent because we tend to focus on the outcome more than the process. Put another way, we're more drawn to the positive feelings of outcomes rather than the struggle of the journey. Most of us quit during the struggle before we can experience the rewards of staying the course.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
        You don’t have to have a gym membership to engage in an effective workout.  You can work out during your lunch break—walking, jogging, bicycling, walking the stairs, and even weight training.  One of the most believed deceptions in society is that you need machines to get a good workout.  But think about the human body and the different exercises you can do without touching a man made object.  Crunches, squats, planks, jumping jacks, and so many more exercises are readily available.
    </p>
    <p class="divimg"><img src="eximg/running.png" class="consistency" title="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinichealthsystem.org%2Fhometown-health%2Fspeaking-of-health%2F6-tips-for-a-successful-run&psig=AOvVaw08SOS_9AcwaD9pnLVYh4lj&ust=1653238716518000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjRxqFwoTCPC42qeI8fcCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAP"></p>
    <p class="p">
        Consistent exercise requires thought and planning.  If you want to stay faithful, you can schedule your exercise time during your favorite television show.  Walk in place, do squats up and down the hallway, lift weights, and stay active.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
    When you exercise regularly, you experience many benefits.  Improving your circulation allows for fatty acids to move through the blood and into the muscle easier, which, in effect, means fat fuels your body.  In addition, the number of mitochondria increases, providing your body with more energy.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
    There are so many fitness routines available online and through programs, but because old habits die hard, it’s difficult to branch out.  Try something new and enjoy consistent exercising.

        The Harmful Effects of Not Getting Enough Physical Activity</h3>
        <div>
            <p><b>Heart Disease </b>Not getting enough physical activity can lead to heart disease—even for people who have no other risk factors. It can also increase the likelihood of developing other heart disease risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
            <p class="divimg"><img src="eximg/heart-disease.png" alt="image-not-found" class="consistency" title="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/young-asian-man-suffer-from-heart-disease-heart-attack-isolated-white-background_177249-428.jpg"></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><b>Type 2 Diabetes</b>Not getting enough physical activity can raise a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps control blood sugar (glucose), weight, and blood pressure and helps raise “good” cholesterol and lower “bad” cholesterol. Adequate physical activity can also help reduce the risk of heart disease and nerve damage, which are often problems for people with diabetes.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p><b>Cancer</b>Getting the recommended amount of physical activity can lower the risk of many cancers, including cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, uterus, esophagus, kidney, lung, and stomach. These effects apply regardless of weight status.</p>

        <h3>Why is consistent exercise necessary?</h3>
        <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.</p>

            <b>Help you control your weight.
            </b>
            Along with diet, exercise plays an important role in controlling your weight and preventing obesity. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat and drink must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat and drink.
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/weight.jpg" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stay-Healthy-Opener-FTR.jpg"></p>

            <b>Reduce your risk of heart diseases.
            </b>
             Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, and heart attack. Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels.

        <h3>10 best exercises for everyone</h3>
        <div class="special-colum">
        1. Lunges
            <p>Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.</p>
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/lunges-exercise.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://c.tenor.com/fWiC9Ze5eUMAAAAC/lunges-exercise.gif"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.</li>
                <li>Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.</li>
                <li>Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of 10 reps.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="two-colum">
            2. Pushups
            <p>Drop and give me 20! Pushups are one of the most basic yet effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.</p> 
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/pushup.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://c.tenor.com/gI-8qCUEko8AAAAC/pushup.gif"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.</li>
                <li>Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you can’t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees — you’ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="two-colum">
            3. Squats
            <p>Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips. Because they engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.</p> 
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/squats.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlueWetHarvestmouse-max-1mb.gif"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.</li>
                <li>Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you’re going to sit in a chair.</li>
                <li>Ensuring your knees don’t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for 1 second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="two-colum">
           4. Standing overhead dumbbell presses
            <p>Compound exercises, which utilize multiple joints and muscles, are perfect for busy bees as they work several parts of your body at once. A standing overhead press isn’t only one of the best exercises you can do for your shoulders, but it also engages your upper back and core.</p>
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/dumbbell.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ExcitableOblongFluke-max-1mb.gif"></p>
            <p><b>Equipment</b>: 10-pound dumbbells</p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a light set of dumbbells — we recommend 10 pounds to start — and start by standing, either with your feet shoulder. Move the weights overhead so your upper arms are parallel to the floor.</li>

           5. Dumbbell rows
            <p>Not only will these make your back look killer in that dress, but dumbbell rows are also another compound exercise that strengthens multiple muscles in your upper body. Choose a moderate-weight dumbbell and ensure that you’re squeezing at the top of the movement.</p>
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/dumbbell-row.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://c.tenor.com/XehF1R8EzM4AAAAC/dumbbell-row.gif"></p>
            <p><b>Equipment</b>: 10-pound dumbbells</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand. We recommend no more than 10 pounds for beginners.</li>
                <li>Bend forward at the waist, so your back is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be certain not to arch your back. Let your arms hang straight down. Ensure your neck is in line with your back and your core is engaged.</li>
                <li>Starting with your right arm, bend your elbow and pull the weight straight up toward your chest.</li>
                <li>Return to the starting position and repeat with the left arm. This is one rep. Repeat 10 times for 3 sets.</li>
            </ol>

           7. Burpees
            <p>An exercise we love to hate, burpees are a super-effective, whole-body move that provides great bang for your buck for cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength.</p> 
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/burpees.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://www.icegif.com/wp-content/uploads/icegif-99.gif"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms down at your sides.</li>
                <li>With your hands out in front of you, start to squat down. When your hands reach the ground, pop your legs straight back into a pushup position.</li>
                <li>Jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if necessary.</li>
                <li>Stand up straight, bringing your arms above your head, and jump.</li>
                <li>This is one rep. Complete 3 sets of 10 reps as a beginner.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="special-colum1">
            7. Single-leg deadlifts
            <p>This is another exercise that challenges your balance. Single-leg deadlifts require stability and leg strength. Grab a light to moderate dumbbell to complete this move.</p>
            <p class="p"><img src="eximg/singleleg.gif" alt="image-not-found" class="eighty_div_img" title="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CaringPassionateCoypu-size_restricted.gif"></p>

                <li>Hinging at the hips, begin to kick your left leg straight back behind you, lowering the dumbbell down toward the ground.</li>
                <li>Repeat 10 to 12 reps before moving the weight to your left hand and repeating the same steps on the left leg. It’s suggested to do 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side.</li>

          8. Side planks
            <p>A healthy body requires a strong core at its foundation, so don’t neglect core-specific moves like the side plank.<br>Focus on the mind-muscle connection and controlled movements to ensure you’re completing this move effectively.</p> 
            <p>Side planks work the deep spinal stabilizing muscle quadratus lumborum . Keeping this muscle strong can help reduce your risk of a back injury. Strengthens your core without stressing your back</p>

           9. Planks
            <p>Planks are an effective way to target both your abdominal muscles and your whole body. Planking stabilizes your core without straining your back the way situps or crunches might.</p>

                <li>Pushing through your heels, raise your hips off the ground by squeezing your core, glutes, and hamstrings. Your upper back and shoulders should still be in contact with the ground, and your core down to your knees should form a straight line.</li>
                <li>Pause 1–2 seconds at the top and return to the starting position.</li>
